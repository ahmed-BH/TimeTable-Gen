# TimeTable-Gen

TimeTable-Gen uses Genetic Algorithms to generate timetables for different classes given courses, lecturers, rooms... 
The resulting timetable is the fittest one through many generations that satistfy fixed rules (other rules for the 'best' timetable will be added)

### Prerequisites

* [python3](https://www.python.org/) should be installed.

* Installing needed python modules:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Running
To test things, run:

```shell
python main.py

```
